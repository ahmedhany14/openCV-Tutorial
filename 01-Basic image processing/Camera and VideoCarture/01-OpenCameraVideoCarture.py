# 1) Open the camera
"""
To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object. Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file.
Device index is just the number to specify which camera. Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply pass 0 (or -1).
You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. But at the end, donâ€™t forget to release the capture.

# 2) Capture the video frame by frame

while True:
    # get a frame

    # ret is a boolean variable that returns true if the frame is available. It reads the frames from the video file one by one.
    # frame is the actual image frame captured from the camera.
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    smaller_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (0, 0), fx=0.5, fy=0.5)
    # 3) Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow("frame", smaller_frame)

    # here it will wait for 1ms and then it will capture the next frame, if you press 'q' it will break the loop and close the camera
    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord("q"):
        break
