# 1) Open the camera
"""
To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object. Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file.
Device index is just the number to specify which camera. Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply pass 0 (or -1).
You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. But at the end, donâ€™t forget to release the capture.

    # get the height and width of the frame
